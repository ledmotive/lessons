    "### Purpose\n",
    "The aim of the final Project is to present the learners with a final opportunity to put their newly acquired skills into practice. The final project has to be scoped ad-hoc - case by case - both by the learner and the teaching staff. The ideal is that it represents enough of a challenge to learners, therefore they are pushed to extend their capabilities and refine their understanding of the different areas of Data Analysis. At the same time, the intention is NOT to provoque frustration or generate so much of a challenge for the learners to be unable to demonstrate skill. \n",

That implies that we're looking forward to checking if the students are not only able to apply the technologies, but also they have a higher-level understanding of the context of the problem, the implications of their decisions, and a general framework of reference - conversations around the topic, ethics, paradoxes, market cases, state of technology, etc. -.
